# V2U | Vertigo 2 - Unleashed

> **Mod for the excellent [Vertigo 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/843390/Vertigo_2/), providing more freedom to the player.**

## New Features

* **Virtual Stock**
    - ‚û°Ô∏è | Interpolates two-handed aiming with the player's approximate shoulder position, giving more stability when aiming down sights.
    - üõ†Ô∏è | Strength, shoulder position, and max distance can be tweaked in `Vertigo2Unleashed.cfg` or the non-VR in-game console (F1).

<p></p>

* **Grip-Holster Mode**
    - ‚û°Ô∏è | Automatically holsters weapons when the grip is released, and equips the last holstered weapon when the grip is held.
    - üõà | Any hand interaction (e.g. grabbing a prop, using the wrist storage) takes priority over equipping the last holstered weapon.
    - üõà | Helps to quickly interact with the world (e.g. collect an item, climb a ladder) without having to open the weapon selection menu.
    - üõ†Ô∏è | Can be toggled  in `Vertigo2Unleashed.cfg`.

<p></p>

* **Difficulty Tweaks**
    - ‚û°Ô∏è | Allows fine-tuning of damage and movement speed.
    - üõà | Both inflicted and taken damage can be tuned, allowing a more deadly and intense (i.e. no bullet sponges) yet fair experience.
    - üõà | Player walking and swimming speed can also be tuned.
    - üõ†Ô∏è | All values can be tweaked in `Vertigo2Unleashed.cfg` or the non-VR in-game console (F1).
 
<p></p>

* **Miscellaneous**
    - ‚û°Ô∏è | Holding the revolver by its foregrip now uses two-handed aiming (including virtual stock support).
